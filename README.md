Add a course by clicking on one of the course options on the first screen, then choose the tee and holes you'd like to play on, and finally, add each player who's playing. When selecting options for the new scorecard, you may click a different option and it will update without having to go back. The course will automatically be saved in an unnamed state, you can access all saved scorecards with the hamburger menu in the top right corner on the header bar.

Click on one of the stroke input cells in the table (light green background on hover) to input a stroke for any player on any hole, and the in/out totals (and total of both if playing all 18 holes) will automatically update on the far right column(s) of the table. Click the "Rename Scorecard" button under/to the right of the scorecard name to input a custom name for the scorecard. Click on the header title (Simple Score) in the top left of the screen to go back to the course selection screen to create a new scorecard.

The page is fully adaptable, so it should work on any screen size.
